I have developed a Prototype for CMG Massage Therapy Website. The web app provides users a seamless experience to learn about different massage services, view pricing details, contact the service team, and conveniently book appointments. The platform features sections such as 'About Us', 'Services', 'Pricing', 'Contact Us', and 'Book Appointment'. It is designed with an intuitive interface and integrated validation for effective form submissions, ensuring a smooth user journey across all pages. 
I hope Tanya and Joseph can easily optimize the site's structure and colors based on what they have already prepared. I focused on starting the project and synchronizing the data with Google or Gmail, especially for contacting us and booking appointments. 
The "Contact Us" form is built to facilitate user inquiries and feedback. Potential clients can enter their name, phone number, email, and a message to contact the CMG team. The form uses validation to ensure the inputs are in the correct format before submission. Once submitted, the data is processed via a Google Apps Script endpoint, which stores the information in Google Sheets for record-keeping and sends a confirmation email to the user. The form also triggers a success message pop-up modal, confirming the submission.
The "Book Appointment" feature allows users to select a massage service, duration, and preferred appointment time while providing personal details such as name, phone number, and email. The app validates booking availability based on business hours and existing appointments in the Google Calendar. It handles confirmation and error messages effectively, displaying appropriate modal pop-ups for success or conflicts like overbooking or out-of-hours bookings. The booking data is saved to Google Sheets, and emails are sent to the client and service provider for confirmation. Also, users receive a reminder email 48 hours before the appointment, ensuring they communicate quickly.
